Potential Use Cases
The World Countries dataset offers numerous possibilities for analysis and exploration. Here are some potential use cases that inspire this research:
1.	Analyze population density and land area to study spatial distribution patterns: Explore how population density varies across countries and investigate the relationship between land area and population concentration.
2.	Investigate the relationship between agricultural land and food security: Examine the percentage of land used for agriculture and its implications for food production, self-sustainability, and food security.
3.	Examine carbon dioxide emissions and their impact on climate change: Analyze carbon dioxide emissions across countries and investigate their correlation with environmental factors, climate change, and sustainability.
4.	Explore correlations between economic indicators and socio-economic factors: Study the relationship between GDP, inflation (CPI), taxation, minimum wage, and other economic indicators to gain insights into the socio-economic landscape of different countries.
5.	Investigate educational enrollment rates and their implications for human capital development: Analyze the gross enrollment ratios for primary and tertiary education to assess the state of education and its potential impact on human capital development.
6.	Analyze healthcare metrics to assess overall well-being: Investigate healthcare indicators such as infant mortality, life expectancy, maternal mortality ratio, out-of-pocket health expenditure, and physicians per thousand to gain insights into the overall well-being and healthcare systems of different countries.
7.	Study labor market dynamics through indicators such as labor force participation and unemployment rates: Explore the labor force participation rates and unemployment rates to understand the dynamics of employment and workforce engagement in different countries.
8.	Investigate the role of taxation and its impact on economic development: Analyze tax revenue as a percentage of GDP, total tax rate, and their impact on economic growth, business environment, and investment attractiveness.
9.	Explore urbanization trends and their social and environmental consequences: Study the percentage of the population living in urban areas and examine the implications of urbanization on social structures, infrastructure development, and environmental sustainability.
